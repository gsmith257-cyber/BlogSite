Hello! My name is Grant, I compete under the name s1n1st3r, and I am a junior penetration tester and cybersecurity professional. I am a certified eJPT, eWPT, Sec+, and CEH (practical) and am currently working on my eCPPT and OSCP. I enjoy doing Hack the Box and TryHackMe rooms as well as CTFs and am practicing my writeup skills here. Please also view my CTF writeups here: [https://s1n1st3r.gitbook.io/ctf-writeups/](https://s1n1st3r.gitbook.io/ctf-writeups/)
